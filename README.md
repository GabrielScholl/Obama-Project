# The Obama Project
⚠️ **_This is a work of fiction._** ⚠️

During the time before a major election to determine the next president of the United States, a political party has called me and asked if I could develop a static web page to their presidential canditate, Mr. Obama. The page should contain a showcase of marketing material and a call to action at the end. I accepted the challenge and got to work.

## The First Step
The first step of the project was to determine exactly what the party's marketing team was looking for. So we sat down and discussed the main contents in detail while I drew a first sketch of how the page should look like, keeping in mind the possibilities and limitations of HTML. Below we can see how it turned out. It was nothing fancy, only a rough positioning of the main elements in the page, with no style yet applied. Those details would come timely, but before that we had to make sure we were on the same page, and it looked like we were. So we all said goodbye and I set off to work on refining the vision and detailing even more the contents before we went on to the next step. Spending enough time on determining the vision and detailing the project now is crutial to avoid having to make costly corrections during more advanced phases of the project.
