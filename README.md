# The Obama Project
⚠️ **_This is a work of fiction._** ⚠️

During the time before a major election to determine the next president of the United States, a political party has called me and asked if I could develop a static web page to their presidential canditate, Mr. Obama. The page should contain a showcase of marketing material and a call to action at the end. I accepted the challenge and got to work.

## The First Step
The first step of the project was to determine exactly what the party's marketing team was looking for. So we sat down and discussed the main contents in detail, while I drew a first sketch of how the page should look like, keeping in mind the possibilities and limitations of HTML. Below we can see how it turned out.  
It was nothing fancy, only a rough positioning of the main elements in the page, with no style yet applied. Those details would come timely, but before that we had to make sure we were on the same page, and it looked like we were. So we all said goodbye and I set off to work on refining the vision, applying some graphic design principles and further detailing the contents before we went on to the next step. The graphic design principles taken into consideration were:
* Proximity
* White space
* Alignment
* Contrast
* Repetition  

Spending enough time on determining the vision and detailing the project now is crutial to avoid having to make costly corrections during more advanced phases of the project. In the end, and before our next meeting, the design of the web page was looking a lot better. For the styling, I went with a color palette consisting of navy blue, white, red and some golden accents, to reference the american flag. Some key ideas for the design were to make it sober, serious and confidence inspiring.
